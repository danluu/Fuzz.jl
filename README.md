You probably don't want to use this. I spent a few minutes writing the most naive possible fuzzer, to see if it would turn up any bugs. Turns out, this terrible method can generate bugs faster than I can debug them. However, the general approach and the specific implementation are pretty lame. If you're looking at this, you probably want something like [Csmith](https://github.com/csmith-project/csmith) or [jsfunfuzz](https://github.com/MozillaSecurity/funfuzz).

I'm planning to, eventually, write a real fuzzer to see if something that generates random expressions turns up more bugs than this. Suggestions / pull requests welcome.

### TODO: debug these bugs

`searchindex` returns an unclear error message: 
~~~
julia> searchindex("q8NWiRVEW3NRTGXW6At7qN5aU2dhJ0ZGHSMfcH50k1Xsn1HIiPNRO0NXVhafnLkEd55","wKPx3QydhlLKz3fZQK3fCVhl6ZwMoFDq18ti1Ozcswi\

`sprandn` with bad args can take an arbitraily long time before erroring out.

`displayable` psuedo-randomly hangs.

`addprocs` of negative `Int128` causes something crazy to happen.

`replace` on string containing bad characters errors out instead of skipping past bad character. See `sandbox/3`.


### Odd non-bugs

[Special casing of some operators](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/julia-users/ljQ-nHpXitU)

Address space randomiziation causes some methods to be randomized across invocations of julia.
